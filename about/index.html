            <h2>About</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Canadian COVID-19 Forecasts web app. Provincial level mathematical modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic is performed here with options for the user to analyze different social distancing strategies.</p>

<p>The people behind this website are researchers in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/" title="University of Waterloo Applied Mathematics">University of Waterlooâ€™s department of Applied Mathematics</a>. </p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
Mathematical models used to describe epidemics are often described by mathematical equations that operate on different compartments of people. We assume the population is split into the following larger compartments: susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and deceased. In the susceptible compartment are individuals who have never had the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the individuals in the exposed compartment are those who have come in contact with the virus and will eventually become symptomatic, but have not yet. The infected compartments is made up of people who have the virus and are symptomatic and contagious. The recovered compartment represents those who have had the virus and so have immunity whereas the deceased compartment represents those individuals whose COVID-19 cases were fatal.

<p>
In the particular model we present in this site, we further split the susceptible, exposed, and infected compartments again into social distancing and social mixing sub-compartments.
