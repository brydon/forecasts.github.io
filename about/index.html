            <h2>About</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Canadian COVID-19 Forecasts web app. Provincial level mathematical modelling of the COVID-19 pandemic is performed here with options for the user to analyze different social distancing strategies.</p>

<p>The people behind this website are researchers in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/applied-mathematics/" title="University of Waterloo Applied Mathematics">University of Waterlooâ€™s department of Applied Mathematics</a>. </p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
Mathematical models used to describe epidemics are often described by mathematical equations that operate on different compartments of people. We assume the population is split into the following larger compartments: susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered, and deceased. In the susceptible compartment are individuals who have never had the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the individuals in the exposed compartment are those who have come in contact with the virus and will eventually become symptomatic, but have not yet. The infected compartments is made up of people who have the virus and are symptomatic and contagious. The recovered compartment represents those who have had the virus and so have immunity whereas the deceased compartment represents those individuals whose COVID-19 cases were fatal.

<p>
In the particular model we present in this site, we further split the susceptible, exposed, and infected compartments again into social distancing and social mixing sub-compartments. Social distancers are individuals who are actively attempt to limit the interaction they have with the rest of the population whereas social mixers are individuals who are not doing so. The differential equations for this system are presented below. Initially, we assume everyone is a social mixer. At a particular start date, we move a proportion \(0\le\theta\le1\) of the population from the mixing category to the requisite distancing category, after some social distancing length, we move the distancers back into the mixing category.

  \frac{d\,S_D}{d\,t}&=-\frac{\beta_{DD}}{N}\,S_D\,I_D-\frac{\beta_{DM}}{N}\,S_D\,I_M\\
  \frac{d\,S_M}{d\,t}&=-\frac{\beta_{MD}}{N}\,S_M\,I_D-\frac{\beta_{MM}}{N}\,S_M\,I_M\\
  \frac{d\,E_D}{d\,t}&=\frac{\beta_{DD}}{N}\,S_D\,I_D+\frac{\beta_{DM}}{N}\,S_D\,I_M - \gamma_D\,E_D\\
  \frac{d\,E_M}{d\,t}&=\frac{\beta_{MD}}{N}\,S_M\,I_D+\frac{\beta_{MM}}{N}\,S_M\,I_M - \gamma_M\,E_M\\
  \frac{d\,I_D}{d\,t}&=\gamma_D\,E_D-(\alpha_D+\delta_D)\,I_D\\
  \frac{d\,I_M}{d\,t}&=\gamma_M\,E_M-(\alpha_M+\delta_M)\,I_M\\
  \frac{d\,R}{d\,t}&=\alpha_M\,I_M+\alpha_D\,I_D\\
  \frac{d\,D}{d\,t}&=\delta_M\,I_M+\delta_D\,I_D

The parameter values for these equations are determined from the raw data courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19" title="Johns Hopkins CSSE">the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University</a>. To assist in the fitting we make some simplifying assumptions, first we assume that \(\gamma_D=\gamma_M\), \(\delta_D=\delta_M\), and \(\alpha_D=\alpha_M\). This corresponds to assuming that the time one spends infected and the latency period of the disease are the same in both distancers and mixers. While we might expect slight variations in these numbers, we do not expect this assumption to be too simplistic. Further, we assume that \(\beta_{DM}=\beta_{MD}\) suggesting that the transmissivity of the disease across compartments is the same. Finally, we assume that \(\beta_{MM}=100\,\beta_{DD}\) and \(\beta_{MM}=20\,\beta_{DM}\). This suggests that Mixer-Mixer interactions are 100 times more likely than Distancer-Distancer interactions and 20 times more likely than Distancer-Mixer interactions.
